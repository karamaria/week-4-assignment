For this project, I have set up the HTML form to submit data to the database and created working GET and POST API routes for smooth communication between the client and server. The database was populated with dummy data using the Supabase query editor. I also improved the page design and added form validation to enhance the user experience.

Next, I plan to add a feature for users to like messages and include a delete button for each post, along with a DELETE route on the server.
